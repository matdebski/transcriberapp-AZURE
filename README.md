# Transcriber - Azure-Based Audio/Video Transcription App

A full-stack serverless application for transcribing audio/video files, using Azure Static Web Apps, Azure Functions, and Blob Storage.

## How the App Works

1. Users upload an audio/video file (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`).
2. The file is sent to an Azure Function (`upload_function`) and stored in Azure Blob Storage.
3. An Azure Service Bus queue is notified about the new file.
4. A background Function picks up the message and triggers transcription using Azure Cognitive Services (Speech-to-Text).
5. The transcribed text is saved in Blob Storage.
6. Users can view/download the transcript through the frontend.
